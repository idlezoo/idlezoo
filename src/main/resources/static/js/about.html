<h3>Fight mechanics</h3>
War... war never changes... when you want to fight with other zoo every your
 animal of some type will fight with animal of that same type of your enemy
 - and they will kill each other! You will win this that local fight if you had
 more animals of that type, or you had same number but you were defending
 (waiting for fight).
<br /> 
Player with more local wins will win the fight. If numbers of local wins are equal
 - defending players wins.
 
<h3>Example</h3>

<li>Player 1 is waiting for fight having 5 Monkeys, 1 Lion, 3 Pandas and 4 Rhinos.
<li>Player 2 attacks having 5 Monkeys, 3 Lions, 2 Pandas and 5 Rhinos
<li>Monkeys fight with 5 dying from each side and Player 1 wins this local fight because he is the defender
